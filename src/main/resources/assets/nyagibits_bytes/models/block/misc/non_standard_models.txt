This folder contains models that aren't fully handled by datagen, for one reason or another.
They still get texture remapping like all other block models.
Each model that is here, should have a reason to. List them below.

Flake: Complex model
Glimmering log and wood: Painful to do in datagen, multiple cases to cover for not much benefit.
